# Linked Lists
A linked list is just a sequence of nodes for which each node holds the address to the next node on the list.
## Generalization
A linked list is a specialized tree. a tree is a specialized graph.

## Implementations
A linked list for which the end node points to the first node is a circular linked list. A linked list for which each node contains the address of the next node **and** the previous node is called a doubly linked list.  
A linked list node can be referred to by a linked list header which just stores meta-info about the linked list, and the address of the first node.
