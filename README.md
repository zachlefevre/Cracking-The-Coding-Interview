# Cracking the Coding Interview
## Zachary LeFevre.

Each chapter section (1.1, 1.2, etc) contains source code for an implementation of the solution.  

The "Ideas" section of the source code emulates the "thinking out loud process". Not every implementation is optimal.

## Road Map:
1. Properly orient data structure packages.
2. Setup cleaner explanations of thougth process and possible solutions in markdown files accompanying problems.
3. Write better tests for each solution and data structure.
4. Setup travis to perform automated builds
